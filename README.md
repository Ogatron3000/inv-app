<h1>Inventory App</h1>

Final project of Amplitudo's Web Academy.

Users can submit tickets to Support or Administration, who can manage them - approve, reject or submit a purchase order to HR. HR can approve/reject purchase orders.

Equipment stats and equipment assigned to specific users can be exported in Excel.

There's also basic CRUD for each model which can be managed by Super Admin.

Built with Laravel.
